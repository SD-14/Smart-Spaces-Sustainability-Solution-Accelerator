# Post-Deployment Verification
Perform the following Steps:

## Confirm Azure Functions - HTTP REST Operations:
This step will confirm the IOTHub deployment and coresponding simulation functionality.

1. Open the Postman Desktop Tool
2. Navigate to the installation of the Azure Function App named FuncSMARTSPACE-HVAC*<inject key="DeploymentID"></inject>:

   ![FnApp](https://github.com/SD-14/Smart-Spaces-Sustainability-Solution-Accelerator/blob/main/images/11.png?raw=true)

3. On the left-hand navigation menu, click on the **Functions** icon.
4. Click on the NAME of the deployed function. It should be named **FuncSMARTSPACE-HVAC**:

   ![Fn](https://github.com/SD-14/Smart-Spaces-Sustainability-Solution-Accelerator/blob/main/images/12.png?raw=true)

5. Once loaded, Click on the **Get Function Url** icon.
6. Click on the **Copy to clipboard** LINK:

   ![FnURL](https://github.com/SD-14/Smart-Spaces-Sustainability-Solution-Accelerator/blob/main/images/13.png?raw=true)

7. PASTE the Azure Function URL into the POSTMan tool URL address bar.
8. Select "POST" as the HTTP Operation.
9. Enter the following JSON string as the RAW BODY Contents:
          {"DeviceID":"smartspace-HVAC01-iotdevice"}

   ![PostmanConf](https://github.com/SD-14/Smart-Spaces-Sustainability-Solution-Accelerator/blob/main/images/14.png?raw=true)
   
10. Click "SEND" in the POSTMan tool and wait for a response.

A successful HTTP reponse message would be "200 OK".

## Confirm Azure SQL Database Table Population:

1. Open SQL Server Management Studio(SSMS) located on desktop.
2. Connect to your newly installed Azure SQL Server Database instance:

        Server Type: Database Engine
        Server Authentication: SQL Authentication
        Server Name: <Your SQL Server Name>.database.windows.net
        
 
 Login: testAdmin    
 Password: smartAdmin-<inject key="DeploymentID"></inject>

3. RIGHT-CLICK on the table: [dbo].[HVACUnitIntermediate] and select "Select top 1000 rows".
4. A new Query window will open and display the query results. 
5. You may wish to add the following SQL to the end of the query to see the most current records: ORDER BY [DateTimeUTC] DESC

A successful deployment will display newly added records to the Azure SQL table -> [dbo].[HVACUnitIntermediate]
