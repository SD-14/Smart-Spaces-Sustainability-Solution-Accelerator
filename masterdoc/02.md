A successful HTTP reponse message would be "200 OK".

## Confirm Azure SQL Database Table Population:

1. Open SQL Server Management Studio(SSMS) located on desktop.
2. Connect to your newly installed Azure SQL Server Database instance, by navigating to the SQL server located in the resource group, and copying the server name:

3. Select Authentication Type as **SQL Server Authentication**, and input the **Server Name, Login, and Password** and connect  as shown below:

    **Login: testAdmin    
    Password: smartAdmin-<inject key="DeploymentID"></inject>**
