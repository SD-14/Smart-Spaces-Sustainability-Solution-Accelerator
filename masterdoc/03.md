#### NOTE: This accelerator contains (3) additional Azure resources to help you effectively manage your Azure cloud spend.

Specifically, the (3) Azure resources consist of the following Items:

#### (1) Azure Function App  
   FuncCreateJWTTOKEN<inject key = "DeploymentID"></inject>

#### (2) Logic Apps:

   LogicApp-ASA-START-<inject key = "DeploymentID"></inject>

   LogicApp-ASA-STOP-<inject key = "DeploymentID"></inject>

These additional Azure resources will allow you to control exactly when and for how long - the Azure Stream Analytics service is running.  

Best practice guidance would be to run the START Logic App every Hour. 
Then trigger the STOP Logic App to run every Hour - BUT FIVE MINUTES After the START Logic App has been triggered.

## Getting Started
Follow the steps below to complete the configuration for these additional Azure resources:

1. Navigate to one of the the Logic Apps highlighted above.

2. Select the option to EDIT the Logic App.

3. DOUBLE-CICK the middle activity named "FuncCreateJWTToken<inject key = "DeploymentID"></inject>".

4. This will open-up the Logic App editor and reveal the JSON payload body as depicted below:

        {
          "applicationid": "<Your App ID>",
          "clientsecret": "<Your Client Secret>",
          "resource": "https://management.azure.com",
          "tenantid": "<Your Tenant ID>"
        }

   In this Solution-Accelerator, the user need not substitute anything as the service-principal values have been replaced accordingly, as the above screenshot is included for reference.
   
5. Click on **Run Trigger** to see the Logic App complete the run successfully:

   ![RunTrigger](https://github.com/SD-14/Smart-Spaces-Sustainability-Solution-Accelerator/blob/main/images/23.png?raw=true)
   
6. Result:
